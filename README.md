# MyPhotos : Hidden Founders intership assignement.
Assignement : https://goo.gl/KmCGAt

P.S: 
 - The getImages method  does not work properly. 
   I followed the exact structure described in https://goo.gl/nD42fR , but I couldn't get image urls.
 - I finished the app by adding a default image url manually, but the general structure is respected. Means, once the getImage will work, I
   can display the photos directly . 
   
Don't hesitate to contact me for any other detail! 


YO!
